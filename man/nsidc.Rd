\arguments{
\item{date_range}{Vector of size two with the start and end dates.
It can be a Date vector or any vector with a valid \code{\link[=as.Date]{as.Date()}} method.}

\item{variables}{Character vector with the variables to fetch. Valid values are
\itemize{
\item cdr_seaice_conc
\item melt_onset_day_cdr_seaice_conc
\item nsidc_bt_seaice_conc
\item nsidc_nt_seaice_conc
\item qa_of_cdr_seaice_conc
\item spatial_interpolation_flag
\item stdev_of_cdr_seaice_conc
\item temporal_interpolation_flag
}}

\item{hemisphere}{Character with the hemisphere to download.
Can be either "south" or "north".}

\item{resolution}{Character with the temporal resolution.
Can be either "monthly" or "daily".}

\item{date_stride}{Numeric with the temporal stride.
A number greater than 1 means to take only the nth date in the series.}

\item{xgrid_range}{Numeric vector of size 2 with the range of the x dimension.}

\item{xgrid_stride}{Numeric with the stride of the x dimension.}

\item{ygrid_range}{Numeric vector of size 2 with the range of the y dimension.}

\item{ygrid_stride}{Numeric with the stride of the y dimension.}

\item{format}{Character with the format.}

\item{file}{Character with the file name to use for download. If \code{NULL},
the file name will be constructed by hashing the request URL.
Requests consisting in more than one file will append a number.}

\item{dir}{Directory where to download the file.}

\item{use_cache}{Logical indicating whether to not perform the download if
the file already exist.}
